Application to append to Lyft Apprenticeship Application


The application does the following:
Accepts a POST request from an input to the route “/test”, which accepts one argument “string_to_cut”
Return a JSON object with the key “return_string” and a string containing every third letter from the original string
(e.g.) If you POST {"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}, it will return: {"return_string": "muydv"}.
